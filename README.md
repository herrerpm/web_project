# Art Gallery

  This is our web project for the first period.

  We're gonna talk about our project in the commit order

# About Page
  Developed the standar design for the whole website, plus added the basic structure
  of the html.
# Navbar
  Created a functional NavBar with bootstrap
# Landing Page
  In this commit we designed the index.html file, which is the page the user lands on when they arrive.
  It worked as a structure of how the other pages would connect and acts like a nice introduction to the
  user.

# Login and Signup Pages
  The login and signup pages were relatively easy as they were just a simple form, nonetheless they
  still have a great design, and stunning visuals.
    
# Footer, Navbar, Faqs Page 
  The next part we worked on was on the footer, to add the links to the pages that were necesarry outside of
  the nav, added a few tweaks to the nav and created the FAQ page.
    
# Add files via upload
  The following commits are part of the same mistake that happened while using git. We forced push a branch by
  accident and it had bugs that rendered the page unreachable. Because of this we had to revert the commit and 
  fix the timeline.

- Repaired files
- Add files via upload
- Revert Add files via upload
- Delete galleries.html
- Delete gallerioes.css
- Add files via upload

# Footer on galleries
  We fixed some errors on the galleries footer, so it would be displayed correctly.
# Added credits
  Added the corresponding credits for the images used in the page.
# Removed Trending
  We had a Trending page however, in the end we realized we had enough pages so we scratched it off
# Removed extra trending references
  We also scratched the references to the links that lead to trending
# Contact Page(aceitedelimon)
  This page at first didn't have a concrete design, we weren't sure what should it contain, 
  if a support assistant button or a FAQ page, at the we made both, which also sends you to
  a form, which once you fill, this one will going to send you to the login page.
# Galleries done
# Redisigned contact
  Our contact page, was a bit messy when talking about the color distribution, so we replaced 
  the absurd amount of black and replace it with some texture and images, we switch the button's styles.

# Footer Contact
  The contact.css had a whole lotta problems, which made that the footer wouldn't detect any of the root.css
  this was rewritten from scratch making the footer look properly.

# Before the end
  A bunch of images, were deleted, in adition to a new credits.css. More likely to give style to the credits page.
# Sign in/up fixed
There was a little problem in the sign in page, which made look weird the form's title, we add some pathing and everything was ok.
