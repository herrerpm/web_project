# Carlos Esteban López Sánchez

During this project I participated in the creation of the page Contact
I did the CSS as well, later this page is modified by my mate Braulio
Even though I didn't have any major responsibilities, I tried being 
careful with the use of colors fonts and content distribution. As well 
one of my roles was to test the page and make sure everything, so I 
participated in the correction of some pages.

My peers did wonderfully, they were extremely patient when explaining 
me something I didn't understand, sometimes I couldn't reach their 
expectatives. 

As well I gladly learn to use Git
